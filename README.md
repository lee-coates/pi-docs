Documentation to assist users of Raspberry Pi

## Hello PI World!
I was so excited to get my first Raspberry Pi, I joyfully dived deep into the remarkable possiblities before me, installing retropie, docker, snap, and several other tools I was shocked to see on such a tiny, afforable system. Like many linux machines I've had before, it wasn't too long before something I tinkered while using one application impacted my desktop experience (*plasma cough-cough*). I don't mind troubleshooting, but it became clear that I had rapidly cluttered my 32 GBs of minimalistic bliss beyond my ability to identify what I added and what simply came out of the box.

Now, I really liked my bespoke playground, but I knew I'd need more information about how the fundamentals worked before I could experiment much further. So, I ordered a few more micro-sd cards, used apt to install the Raspberry Pi Imager, and with the help of NOOBS and a sd card reader, I started fresh with Raspberry Pi OS.

And that's where I am at the time of the second commit of this README. There will be many changes moving forward, but the goal of this repo is to document discoveries about the base system and record changes (both beneficial and detrimental) along the way. That way, when I want to test out flatpack, kubernetes, and plasma, I'll understand where something unexpected could be coming from. Also, I better get on an ssd before I expect to do too much more!

I'm writing these docs for myself; if they help anyone else or someone spots something wrong, please feel free to submit an issue or pull request!
