## Contribute

Welcome to the pi-docs repo and thanks for considering giving back to this collection of knowledge. All of the information in this site is cataloged from first-hand experience and does not reflect any official instruction from the Raspberry Pi Foundation. If you spot something incorrect or have anything valuable to add, please start by creating a Bug or Feature request to help connect check-ins with planned changes. As this repo is under branch protection, this page has been included to assist users with the process.

Please note contributors of this repo are expected to follow the code of conduct included below.

### Pull Request Process

This repo leverage GitHub pages to serve these pages with a jekyll theme. Thanks to GitHub, no local build is necessary. Simply add or edit a markdown file via a pull request, and GH does the rest. Thanks GitHub!!!

Since changing the site is so easy, contribution is limited to collaborators and the main branch is under a protection rule that requires a completed review on the pull request. This process is very simple and fosters a healthier community. Everything is done through the web browser, so jump into the pi-docs repo and let's get started:

1. Head to the Issues or Discussion tab to see if your idea is already listed. If it is, add a comment to discuss. If it's not, add a new one!
2. Navigate to location of change. Add/Edit relevant page (must end in .md). Since you won't be a collaborator, GitHub will automatically create a fork for you in your own account. 
3. Add your content and use the Propose new file/changes to describe what the commit does. On the next screen, select Create pull request. 
4. On the Open a pull request screen, enter a title and comment for this change. This comment is less about what the code does and more about discussion with the collaborators. Here is where you can tie the change to the Issue you are working on using [GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) (i.e. include a keyword and the issue number in the description of the PR). Pull Requests can be linked to Issues through the Issues tab in the web browser as well.
5. If you are a collaborator, you don't need to fork the repo and instead can just create your PR off a dev branch. Either way, a review will still be required for the commit to main.
6. Your Pull Request will be reviewed as soon as possible. Celebrations should be had as you're done!
