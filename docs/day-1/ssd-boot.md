# SSD Boot
One of the most spectacular aspects of the Raspberry Pi is its simplicity and ease of use. There's a sense of freedom in needing so few components and being so close to the chip. The machine draws so little energy ([1010mA/5.1W at regular load!](https://www.pidramble.com/wiki/benchmarks/power-consumption)) yet is capable enough to play 4K video, serve web content, develop, design, store, and the list goes on. All of this on top of an SD Card at that! Why disrupt this simplistic bliss? Why bother adding another device, more cables, and taking more steps! Just insert, boot, and create!

The answer is simple: personal computers need ample storage space.

Sure there are performance gains and potential cost savings in purchasing less cards over time, but the main driver for me is the expectation that my personal PC will have enough space for me to store assets for dozens of projects at one time. Even with cloud backups--having content close to the OS is effective. And of course there are more options, but switching daily operations from an sd card to a solid state drive is easy and will save so much time, energy, and ability in the long run.

So let's get started!
