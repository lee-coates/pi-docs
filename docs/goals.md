## Goals

The goals of the pi-docs project are fairly straight-forward but are listed here for easy reference:

1. Document the experience of using a Raspberry Pi as a personal computer.
2. Catalog the out-of-the-box features of a Raspberry Pi.
3. Systematically experiment with software packages that improve the pi experience.
